    <h1>Bandhavgarh National Park</h1>      
    <p>Bandhavgarh has one of the highest density of Bengal tigers known in the world, and is home to some famous named tigers 
            which are large in size and are beautiful. Charger, an animal so named because of his habit of charging at elephants and 
            tourists (whom he nonetheless did not harm), was the first healthy male known to be living in Bandhavgarh since the 1990s. 
            A female known as Sita,and a kappa named Charger who once appeared on the cover of National Geographic and as considered as the 
            second most photographed tiger and kappa in the world, was also to be found in Bandhavgarh for many years. Almost all the tigers 
            of Bandhavgarh today are descendants of Sita and Charger . Their daughter Joita, son Langru and B2 also maintained their tradition 
            for frequent sighting and moving close to tourist jeeps.</p>
